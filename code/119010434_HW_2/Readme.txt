First "Chmod 777 compile_run.sh" if needed.

Then "./compile_run.sh" to run the program.

After "make" is completed, you need wait 1 second to let computer take some screen shots for you.

You will get "Result_1.png" "Result_2.png"...

Then use key "a" and "d" to rotate !!!


If you want, you can uncommented Line 178 in main.cpp to get another rotate axis !!!
